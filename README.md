# BeatSaber_HSVLayer
Simple plugin that modify the HSV layer from UI to X instead

Currently only change the layer from 5 (UI) to 4 (Floor) instead, no configuration available.

Useful if you want to turn off all UI on Camera2 for your Desktop screen but still show HSV, for recording or streaming, etc.
